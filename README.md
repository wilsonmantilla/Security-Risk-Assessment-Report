<h1>Security Risk Assessment Report</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I tackled a scenario involving a significant data breach. My task was to propose three hardening tools or methods to mitigate four major vulnerabilities.. This project was part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification.



<h2>Scenario</h2>
You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 
After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:
<br />
<br />


- The organization’s employees' share passwords.
- The admin password for the database is set to the default.
- The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
- Multi Factor authentication (MFA) is not used. 
- If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.

<h2>Part one: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement</h2>

To address identified vulnerabilities, the organization can employ three key hardening tools:

1. Implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA)
2. Enforcement of strong password policies
3. Creation of Firewall rules

MFA enhances security by requiring users to authenticate using multiple methods, such as fingerprint scans, ID cards, pins, or passwords. Strong password policies can include rules on length, character types, and discouragement of password sharing. Firewall rules dictate how network traffic is allowed or blocked based on a predefined criteria.

<h2>Part two: Explain your recommendations</h2>

Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) makes it harder for threat actors to break into our network using brute force attacks. It also prevents password sharing, which is crucial for employees with high-level access. 

Having a strong password policy makes it difficult for threat actors to access our network. We need to consistently enforce these rules to boost user security.

Implementing firewall rules is essential for preventing unauthorized access to our network. It mitigates the risk of security breaches and data leaks by blocking potentially harmful traffic.
